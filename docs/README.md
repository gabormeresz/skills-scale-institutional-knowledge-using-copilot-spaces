# OctoAcme — Project Management Overview (README)

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Every project flows through a structured lifecycle: [Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) validates the business need and defines success metrics, [Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md) breaks work into actionable increments with clear acceptance criteria, [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) manages day-to-day delivery through daily standups and weekly syncs, [Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) standardizes production rollouts with smoke tests and rollback plans, and finally [Retrospectives](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md) capture learnings to drive continuous improvement. This end-to-end process ensures teams deliver small, testable increments while maintaining transparency and alignment with stakeholders.

Teams are built around well-defined [roles and personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md): Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, and risk communications; Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success; Developers implement features and collaborate on design; and QA validates quality against acceptance criteria. Communication follows a consistent cadence with weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, and monthly stakeholder updates. Key artifacts include the Project Charter, roadmap and release plans, sprint backlogs with clear Definition of Done, and risk registers that are reviewed and updated regularly. For more details on our approach to managing uncertainties and keeping stakeholders informed, see [Risks & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md).

Quality assurance is embedded throughout the process, with unit tests for new logic, integration and end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI pipelines before release. Teams use project boards (like GitHub Projects) to track work through Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done columns. Pull requests are kept small (≤400 lines when possible), include issue links and acceptance criteria, and require at least one approval before merging. Metrics such as velocity, burndown, and product success indicators are monitored via dashboards, and blockers are escalated systematically from team-level triage to PM, Product Lead, and sponsor as needed.

These documents provide the foundation for how we run cross-functional projects and can be added to `.copilot/` to give Copilot Spaces context-aware guidance tailored to your team's workflows.
